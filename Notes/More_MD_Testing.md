# H1 Header (Main Title)

Welcome to a sample Markdown document. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax, designed so that it can be converted to HTML and many other formats.

## H2 Header (Section Title)

### H3 Header (Sub-section Title)

This paragraph contains some basic text formatting. You can make text *italic* (using asterisks or underscores) or **bold** (using double asterisks or underscores). You can also combine them, like ***bold and italic***.

> This is a blockquote. It's often used for citations or to highlight specific information.
> 
> *   Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements too.

## Links and Images

Here is a standard [inline link to Google](https://www.google.com "Google's Website").

If your editor supports image rendering within the preview, you might see a broken link icon below (since the URL is a placeholder):

![Alt text for a placeholder image](https://example.com/placeholder-image.jpg "Optional Title")

## Code and Horizontal Rules

Inline code can be wrapped in single backticks, like so: `<div>` or `console.log('hello');`.

You can also create a code block using three backticks (fenced code blocks):

```python
def hello_world():
    """Prints a greeting to the console."""
    print("Hello, world!")

hello_world()
