how useful is it to know and write LaTeX / Markdown

Short answer first:

Knowing Markdown is immediately useful.
Knowing LaTeX becomes increasingly valuable the further you go in academia.

They solve different problems, and together they form a very powerful writing toolkit.

Markdown — high utility, low effort (start here)
What it is

A simple plain-text way of writing that turns into nicely formatted documents.

Example:

## Methods
We used a Monte Carlo simulation with **10,000 iterations**.

Why it’s useful

Extremely easy to learn (1–2 hours)

Works everywhere:

VS Code

GitHub

Jupyter notebooks

README files

documentation

Perfect for:

project notes

lab logs

READMEs

methods drafts

reproducibility documentation

For your work

Markdown is ideal for:

explaining Monte Carlo logic

documenting analysis decisions

writing methods alongside code

keeping clean, searchable notes

Markdown is like scientific note-taking that ages well.

LaTeX — high payoff, higher learning curve
What it is

A typesetting system used for:

journal papers

theses

grants

equations

figures

references

Example:

\begin{equation}
P(X > x) = 1 - F(x)
\end{equation}

Why it matters in academia

Gold standard for:

math-heavy writing

neuroscience / physics / CS papers

theses and dissertations

Handles:

equations correctly

references automatically

figure numbering perfectly

formatting consistently

Where it really shines

NSERC-style documents

multi-figure papers

revisions with supervisors

journals that accept .tex submissions

Word vs Markdown vs LaTeX (honest comparison)
Tool	Best for	Weakness
Word	quick drafts, admin	breaks easily, formatting pain
Markdown	notes, docs, READMEs	limited layout control
LaTeX	papers, thesis, grants	learning curve

Most experienced academics use more than one.

The real power move (what strong labs do)

They separate thinking from formatting.

Typical professional workflow

Markdown

outline ideas

write methods

keep lab notes

Jupyter / MATLAB

generate figures & stats

LaTeX

assemble final paper or thesis

This avoids fighting Word formatting at 2 AM.

How useful is it for you specifically?

Given your trajectory (PhD-level neuroscience + computation):

Markdown — ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (essential)

Start now

Zero downside

Immediate benefit

LaTeX — ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (strategic)

You don’t need mastery immediately

Basic competency pays off massively later

Especially valuable if you:

publish

write grants

collaborate internationally

What I recommend you do (practical plan)
Step 1 (now)

Use Markdown everywhere:

project notes

READMEs

analysis explanations

Step 2 (when writing formal documents)

Learn LaTeX basics only:

sections

figures

references

equations

You can learn 20% of LaTeX and get 80% of the benefit.

One reassuring truth

You do not have to abandon Word.

Many people:

think in Markdown

publish in LaTeX

submit drafts to supervisors in PDF

copy text into Word if required

Bottom line

Markdown improves how you think and document science.
LaTeX improves how your science is presented to the world.

If you want next, I can:

show Markdown inside VS Code (5-minute setup)

give you a LaTeX minimal template for neuroscience

map Markdown → LaTeX → PDF cleanly

design a PhD repo that uses both naturally

Just tell me which direction you want to go.

Youtube video overview and/or tutorials - 1 on markdown and 1 on LaTeX

Here are useful YouTube tutorials you can watch to get up and running with Markdown and LaTeX — good for beginners and practical learning:

A clear beginner-friendly overview of Markdown syntax and how it’s used everywhere (GitHub, docs, READMEs, etc.).

Why this one: Covers common formatting (headings, lists, code, links, images) and gives you confidence writing Markdown quickly.

A full beginner tutorial on LaTeX from freeCodeCamp — takes you through creating and formatting documents with LaTeX.

Why this one: Comprehensive and beginner-friendly with lots of examples covering structure, math, tables, and document workflows.

Good thinking about how to use them

Markdown

Great for documentation, READMEs, notes

Works seamlessly inside VS Code

Useful even if you never write research papers

LaTeX

Ideal for academic papers, theses, math notation, reference management

More powerful but has a learning curve

You’ll use it a lot in graduate-level research
